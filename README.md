# 👋 Hi, I'm Abish — DevOps Engineer

DevOps Engineer with 5+ years of experience building **AWS infrastructure at scale**, automating deployments with **Terraform & Ansible**, and shipping code daily via **modern CI/CD pipelines**.  
Strong hands-on background in **Kubernetes, Docker, Linux**, and **cloud security**.

I specialize in making systems **reliable, secure, observable, and cost-efficient** — turning infrastructure into a competitive advantage.

📍 Miami, FL  
✅ Authorized to work for any U.S. employer (no visa sponsorship required)

## 🚀 What I Do

- Design and operate **multi-region AWS architectures**
- Build **Infrastructure as Code** with Terraform & Ansible
- Automate deployments using **GitHub Actions & ArgoCD**
- Implement **observability stacks** for data-driven incident response
- Harden cloud environments for **security & compliance (SOC2)**
- Optimize cloud costs without sacrificing reliability

---

## 🧠 Key Achievements

- Architected **12+ enterprise AWS environments** across **3 regions** with automatic failover and cross-region replication
- Reduced environment provisioning time from **5 days → 4 hours** by fully automating infrastructure (50+ components)
- Enabled **50+ deployments per week** (vs. 2 manual releases) with automated testing, security scanning, and rollback
- Built observability stack (**Prometheus, Grafana, ELK**) for **30+ microservices**, cutting MTTR from **2 hours → 8 minutes**
- Eliminated **200+ hard-coded secrets**, achieving **SOC2 compliance** using Vault, IAM, and VPC segmentation
- Reduced AWS spend by **$120K annually** via VPC optimization, RIs, and spot instances
- Resolved critical production network incidents (**TCP/IP, DNS, TLS, VPN**) restoring $6M+ customer connectivity in under 45 minutes
